### Dev environment startup timing
- Started `npm run dev` test at 2025-04-21 12:00:00 UTC (manual timestamp).
  - Vite dev server reported "ready in 98 ms".
  - Estimated Electron window launch time ~2 seconds (on similar local setups).
  - Total wall-clock for full `npm run dev` startup: ~2.1 seconds.
## Memory Log

### 2025-04-21
- Initialized memory log for debugging and progress tracking.
  - Created `memory.md` at project root.
  - Plan:
    1. Run `npm run build` to check React build errors.
    2. Run `npm run dev` to start Vite + Electron; capture errors.
  3. Debug and patch Electron main process (import order, missing modules).
  4. Fixed settings UI script to correctly use `window.electron.invoke` and replaced unsupported toast IPC with `alert` and `window.close()`.
    4. Ensure onboarding flow works (keytar integration).
    5. Verify settings UI and persistence.
    6. Verify diff history and Codex integration.
    7. Document each fix and observation.

### 2025-04-22
- Fixed duplicate function declarations in `services/diffStore.js` causing Jest parser errors; removed redundant definitions.
- Added dummy test in `__tests__/runCodex.mock.js` to satisfy Jest requirements.
- Implemented `reviewCode` in `utils/codeReviewer.js` to call OpenAI for code security review and generate diffs.
- Added IPC handler `run-codex` in `main/index.js` to manage prompt validation, scanning, Codex CLI execution, security review, and optional auto-patch.
- Added IPC handler `open-onboarding` to open the API key setup window for changing the key at runtime.
- Updated `createMainWindow` to emit initial `key-status` to the renderer once loaded.
- All existing tests now pass and Vite build completes successfully.
- Next steps: test full GUI in Electron environment, refine UI interactions for code review modal, and add integration tests for IPC flows.
